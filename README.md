# Speech-Organ-Visualization
visualize speech organs dymanically using shiny

This still very simplistic project was inspired by [Maya Gan's Body Visualization](https://github.com/MayaGans/Human-Body-Rendering-HTML) and [gganatogram](https://github.com/jespermaag/gganatogram). Improvements are welcomed
